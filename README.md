# Chronicles of The Monkey 悲しい歴史

_Documenting the hidden truths behind the local legends._

## The Truth Behind the Name

This isn't just some weird nickname thrown around the halls. It's a marker. A scar. Something you only understand if you've been here long enough, seen enough of the cracks underneath the perfect surface. "The Monkey"... yeah. It started as a cruel joke, maybe, or maybe just a way to label something people didn't want to understand. But the history? That's the sad part. The real sad part.

Let's be clear: this isn't about an animal. It's about a person.

### I. The Promise

Before the whispers, before the avoidance, there was... brilliance. Potential. Laughter that felt like sunshine on a cold day. I won't write the name here – some things deserve what little privacy remains. But imagine someone who had it all figured out. Top of their class, genuinely kind, effortlessly charismatic in a way that made you want to be better. They had plans. Big ones. Plans that felt solid, real, like they could actually change things. Everyone looked up to them. Teachers adored them. Other students? They were the standard we all quietly measured ourselves against. There was no doubt they were going to fly.

### II. The Breaking

Life isn't fair. We all know that, right? But sometimes it's actively cruel. For them, it wasn't one big bang. It was a series of calculated, relentless blows.

   A betrayal. Not just a small one, but a fundamental trust broken by someone closest to them. The kind that hollows you out.
   A loss. Something vital snatched away. Not just a person, but perhaps a dream, an opportunity, a core part of their identity tied to that person or event.
   The pressure. The weight of expectations, their own and everyone else's, became crushing when the foundation started to crumble. They couldn't show weakness. They were the 'strong' one.

They tried to hold on. We saw it. The smiles that didn't reach their eyes, the strained energy. They were swinging from branch to branch, higher and higher, desperately trying not to fall, even as the branches splintered beneath them.

### III. The Change (and the Name)

The fall wasn't a clean break. It was a shattering.

The predictability vanished. The focus dissolved. They became erratic. Distrustful. Prone to sudden bursts of panic or withdrawal. They started avoiding people, hiding in plain sight. Found comfort in high places – literally. rooftops, the tops of bleachers, old climbing frames in abandoned parks. Observing from a distance. Flinching at sudden movements or loud noises.

Their movements changed too. Less graceful, more... skittish. Jumping away from contact, darting into shadows. Someone, watching them scramble away from a group, desperate to be alone, probably trying to escape the stares, the pity, or maybe just the noise inside their own head... they called them "The Monkey."

> "Look at 'em... just like a scared monkey, scrabbling away."

And because cruelty sticks, especially when it gives people a convenient label for something they don't want to deal with, it stuck. It wasn't just a name; it became their identity to everyone else. The bright promise was gone, replaced by this haunted, unpredictable shell.

### IV. The Echo

Now, "The Monkey" is a ghost story for freshmen, a cautionary tale whispered by seniors who think they're world-weary. People see glimpses – a shadow in the upper library stacks, a figure perched on the edge of the old gym roof at dusk, the briefest flash of eyes in the trees bordering the field.

But we who saw the before... we don't see a legend. We see the person who was broken. We see the vibrant light that was extinguished, leaving behind only this jittery, solitary existence. Every time someone uses the name, even casually, it's a reminder of what was lost. The potential, the future, the simple joy of being themselves. They are trapped, not by bars, but by whatever trauma made them climb so high to get away from us all.

And the saddest part? Most people don't even remember who they were before they became "The Monkey." They just see the result.

## Notes from the Chronicler

Yeah, I'm popular. I go to the parties, I get the good grades, I know everyone. But being on the inside sometimes just gives you a clearer view of the outside, of the people pushed to the edges. Some stories just stick with you. This one should stick with everyone.

Don't just see "The Monkey." Try, just for a second, to remember the promise. That's where the real tragedy lies.
